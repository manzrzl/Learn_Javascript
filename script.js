//console.log => This is particularly useful when you want to see if a function is executing, 
//or if a variable is being passed/assigned properly. It's actually rather valuable for figuring out 
//just what went wrong with your code.

//console.log('Hey');
//console.warn('This is a warning message')
//console.error('fetching failed')
//console.log(window);
//console.log(document);
//console.log(innerHeight)
//console.log(window.screen)
//console.log(window.screen.height)
//console.log(screen.height)

//document.write => The Document.write() method writes 
//a string of text to a document stream opened by document.open().

//document.write("Show me the code!")

//Difference Between const and var and let =>
//const => A const variable cannot be reassigned: 
//const price = 10;
//console.log(price);
//price = 100;
//console.log(price)
//=>Uncaught TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'price'

//var => Variables defined with let can be redeclared.
//var myprice = 100
//console.log(myprice);
//myprice = 200
//console.log(myprice)
//=>Doesn't Give Error

//let => Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared.
//let x = "Manoj Rijal"
//let x = 0
//=>Uncaught SyntaxError: redeclaration of let x

//String Concatenation: string.concat(), + , template literals
//+
//const price = 100
//console.log("A pen costs: "+price)
//string.concat()
//var myText = "A pencil costs: ".concat(price)
//console.log(myText)
//template literals
//var myText = `The price of a eraser is: ${price}`
//console.log(myText)
